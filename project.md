# Empirical Project

Students will work individually or in groups of two or three to complete 
an empirical project on a topic of their choice (that is related to the course).  Empirical 
projects should fall into one of the broad categories of empirical micro papers 
discussed on Methods Monday 2.

## Group Composition and Topic Statement

_Due Monday September 30._

Students wishing to work together should form groups as soon  
as possible.  The maximum group size is three.  Each group 
will need to submit a brief statement (a few sentences long) 
indicating the topic or topics they are interested in.

## Research Group Meetings

_Week of October 14._

Each group will meet with Professor Jakiela during the week of 
October 14 to discuss their topic.  Prior to these meetings, 
each group should review the feedback they have received on their 
Topic Statements.  Students should arrive at the meeting 
prepared to outline their proposed paper topic.
