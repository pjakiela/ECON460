# Data Analysis Assignment 2

_Data Assignment 2 is due by 11:00 PM on October 7._

# Overview

For this assignment, we will be replicating and extending the analysis presented 
in Alberto Alesina, Paola Giuliano, and Nathan Nunn's paper 
[On the Origins of Gender Roles:  Women and the Plough](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/128/2/469/1943509).  To do this, 
we will combine the cross-country data from the authors' replication files with 
the World Bank's [Women, Business, and the Law](https://wbl.worldbank.org/en/wbl) database.  This will allow us 
to explore the association between traditional use of the plough in agriculture and 
legal protection of women's rights.
