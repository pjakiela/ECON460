# Course Overview

_Women, Work, and the World Economy from 5,000 BC to the Present_  

<br>

## Course Description

Now and throughout history, views of the appropriate role for women in society have varied tremendously across cultures and communities: are women autonomous productive agents, are they men's property, or do they fall somewhere in between? In this course, we explore the causes and consequences of women's position in society for growth and economic development, analyzing women's economic roles in historical and cultural perspective. Students will become more critical readers of current economic literature, and will apply their skills in conducting empirical research.
