# Data Analysis Assignment 2

_Data Assignment 2 is due by 11:00 PM on October 7._

## Overview

For this assignment, we will be replicating and extending the analysis presented 
in Alberto Alesina, Paola Giuliano, and Nathan Nunn's paper 
[On the Origins of Gender Roles:  Women and the Plough](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/128/2/469/1943509).  To do this, 
we will combine the cross-country data from the authors' replication files with 
the World Bank's [Women, Business, and the Law](https://wbl.worldbank.org/en/wbl) database.  This will allow us 
to explore the association between traditional use of the plow in agriculture and 
legal protection of women's rights.  

## Getting Your Data

Replication files for Alesina, Giuliano, and Nunn's paper on the plow are available from 
[Professor Nunn's website](https://nathannunn.arts.ubc.ca/data/).  You'll be using the 
cross-country data file, and you should also extract their do file from the zipped folder.  

The second data set is the World Bank's [Women, Business, and the Law database](https://wbl.worldbank.org/en/wbl-data), 
which contains information on legal protections for women in 190 countries.  You can download the data in Stata format, 
or as an Excel spreadsheet if you prefer.
