# Data Analysis Assignment 1

_Data Assignment 1 is due by 11:00 PM on Septmeber 23._

## Overview

In this assignment, you will be asked to analyze cross-country data on outcomes related to women's empowerment and wellbeing.  You 
are going to choose two variables from the [World Development Indicators (WDI) database](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators); 
your task is to examine the relationship between them and present your findings in a clear and compelling way.  

There are two basic approaches to this assignment.  One approach is to consider the association between a measure of economic or social development (e.g. GDP per capita or the adult literacy rate) and an outcome related to women's participation in the economy (e.g. maternal mortality or take-up of modern contraception).  The other approach is to examine the empirical relationship between two gender-focused outcomes (e.g. the gender gap in primary school enrollment and the extent to which women's rights are legally protected).  

There is no expectation that you uncover a causal relationship; your analysis can be purely descriptive.  That said, you may want to motivate your analysis with some plausible causal story.  Whether or not you choose to do this, you will want to think carefully about which of your two outcomes should serve as the dependent variable.

## Getting Your Data

The first step is to choose your variables from the 
World Bank's [World Development Indicators (WDI) database](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators).  You can explore the 
variables in the WDI by clicking on the `Database` tab on the left side of the WDI webpage, choosing the database that you want to explore, and 
then clicking on the `Series` tab to see a list of available variables.  You should focus on the `World Development Indicators` and `Gender Statistics` 
databases (which you can choose on the `Database` tab).

## Analyzing Your Data


## Presenting Your Results

Your final product for this assignment should be a 3 to 5 page pdf containing your tables and figures and a short write-up of your analysis.
