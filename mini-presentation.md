# Mini-Presentation

You and your project group will choose one ancient or early society 
and prepare a short (5 slides, under 10 minutes) presentation about the status 
of women in that society.  The society can be one of the seven that is discussed in 
the reading by Bruce Trigger, or it can be any other civilization or cultural group 
up to 1500 CE.  

Your presentation will reference at least four sources, no more than one of which 
should be a required course reading.  You must identify at least two sources that 
are not listed in the Reading List.  Sources should not be websites; they should 
either be peer-reviewed journal articles (not necessarily from economics) or 
books (including e-books) available from the Williams Library.

Your presentation will include (exactly) five slides:

1. A **title slide**.  Your title should include the name of your civilization or culture, and your title slide should include the names of all group members.
2. An **introduction slide** which characterizes your civilization or society:  who, where, and when was it?  You might include a map.  
3. Two **content slides** providing information on the economic position of women in your civilization or society.  Distill information from multiple sources into clear bullet points.  Include a table or figure from a source if that is helpful.  Make sure any quotes are clearly indicated.
4. A **references** slide listing your sources.
