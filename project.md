# Empirical Project

Students will work individually or in groups of two or three to complete 
an empirical project on a topic of their choice (that is related to the course).  Empirical 
projects should fall into one of the broad categories of empirical micro papers 
discussed on [Methods Monday 2](ECON460-methods2-slides-2022-09-22.pdf).

## Group Composition and Topic Statement

_Due Friday September 30 by 11:00 PM._

Students wishing to work together should form groups as soon  
as possible.  The maximum group size is three.  Each group 
will need to submit a brief statement (a few sentences long) 
indicating the topic or topics they are interested in.

## Research Group Meetings

Each group will meet with Professor Jakiela during the week of 
October 19 to discuss their topic.  Prior to these meetings, 
each group should review the feedback they have received on their 
Topic Statements.  Students should arrive at the meeting 
prepared to outline their proposed paper topic.  

## Annotated Bibliography

_Due Sunday November 6 by 11:00 PM._

A review of 6-8 sources, at least four of which are from peer-reviewed economics 
journals.  Professor Jakiela will suggest at least three papers, two of which 
must be included in the annotated bibliography.  The papers should inform 
the proposed research design.

## Research Proposal

_Due Sunday November 13 by 11:00 PM._

A detailed outline for the proposed empirical project including a 
draft introduction, a draft literature review, a summary statistics 
table, and a detailed outline of the set of tables and figures that 
will be included in the analysis.

## Slides for In-Class Presentation

_Due Tuesday November 29 by 11:00 PM._

## Final Written Project

_Due Friday December 16 by 11:00 PM._
