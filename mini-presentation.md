# Mini-Presentation

You and your project group will prepare a short (5-6 slides, 10 minutes) presentation of the results of an empirical paper on the historical roots 
of modern gender norms. You objective is to teach us about the paper by summarizing the research question, the data collected to explore the research question, 
and the main empirical results.  

Your presentation will include 5-6 slides:  

1. A **title slide**.  Your title slide should include the title of the paper, the names of the authors, and the names of all group members.  
2. A **motivation slide** (this could also be called a research question slide) which explains the research question that the authors seek to answer and provides a very big-picture overview of how they will answer it.  
3. A slide presenting a key **figure** (possibly a map) from the paper.  
4. Two **empirical results slides** presenting the key regression findings from the paper.  Be prepared to explain the empirical specification used and the pattern of results.  
5. A **conclusion** slide that summarizes the main findings of the paper and your interpretation of them.

The are so-called egg-timer talks because they are short, and you will not be allowed to go over the time limit.  You have 10 minutes; after ten minutes, we'll ask you to stop talking whether you've finished your presentation or not. This means you need to practice your discussion of the slides, and also that you should make sure that you don't spend too long on the introduction.   

Presentations will take place in class on September 25. You must email your slides to Professor Jakiela before 11:00 AM on the day of your presentation.
